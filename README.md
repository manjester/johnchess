### John Chess is my own chess variation based on John. 

John is not very chess-literate, he doesn't even know about checks! He gets his own king captured because he isn't aware he has to move it. He doesn't know about the en passent, the promotion, the castling... He's just in it for the fun.

My implementation of "John" within the game. Launch this file instead if you want to play against the John Chess highest-rating FIDE classified Grandmaster.

## Rules

No castling, no 50-move rule, no threefold repetition, no promotion, no enpassent, no castling.

Only _pure unfiltered fun_.

**You win if your king is captured! Good luck!**

> "The game say "Black wins!" when you're playing white and you got your king captured. That's a bug, probably" - John

## Who is John?
**John** can be whoever you want. Maybe John is a cool sub-urban guy in his 30s who takes serious interest in chess, or a 14-year-old who only enjoys playing video games and eating snacks, or a man who's been a professional chess player for 30 years. 

It's up to you, that's the most beautiful thing about John.
